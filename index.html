                    <p>Hello. My name is Megan Cullins, and I am a Francophile. My love of all things French started
                            around the 8th grade. One of my friends had taken a French language course the year before and
                            I decided that sounded like fun. I signed up myself and that was it. After my first couple of 
                            classes I was hooked. My obession only increased the summer after my Sophmore year in high
                            school when I had the opportunity to travel myself. Here are a few highlights of my travels, 
                            and why I am so taken with France.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Paris</h2>
                    <p>Paris, the City of Light, was the first place I visited when I went to France. It's has wonderfully
                        beauiful architecture. There is plenty to do, from the museums to the monuments. Then if you get tired
                        of that, you can spend all day just wandering the streets and be entertained, stopping every so often
                        for a Cafe au Lait at one of the many quaint Cafes all across the city. This is the place I went for 
                        my honeymoon and will always hold a special place in my heart. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Normandy</h2>
                    <p>There is a certian heartbreaking beauty to Normandy. It is a land of rolling hills interspersed with 
                        small groups of trees. It is eerie though, to think that so many have lost their lives among the 
                        beauty of this land. No where is this more prominent than on a visit to Omaha Beach. The main thing
                        that I was surprised at was that the beach is at the base of a really steep hill, much steeper than 
                        I have gathered from movies. Thinking of having to run up this steep hill under fire is terrifying.

                    <h2>Saint-Malo</h2>
                    <p>Saint-Malo is arguably my favorite city on Earth. It is perched on a hillside above the northern coast 
                        of France. The water surrounding the city is an undescribably beaufiul blue green. Walking the ramparts 
                        of this walled city, feeling the sea breeze and surveying the waters of the sea, it is easy to find 
                        yourself romanticizing the violent past of the city. Saint-Malo was notorious for being the home of 
                        pirates, and suffered greatly from the bombs of the Germans during WWII.

                    <h2>Mont St. Michel</h2>
                    <p>Mont St. Michel is a whimsical mountian of a city. The entire city spirals upwards around
                        an old abbey, and is often surrounded entirely by water when the tide is high. If you haven't 
                        seen pictures, all you have to imagine is a freestanding Minas Tirith from Lord of the Rings, Mont
                        St. Michel was it's inspiration. It is famous for it's lamb, which inherit a saltiness from the 
                        grass it eats. Due to the fact that half of the time the land surrounding the city is underwater,
                        therefore the saltwater flavors the grass in turn flavoring the sheep. I'm not sure how this actually
                        tastes though, when I visited I had a ham and butter samwich for lunch, a French specialty.

                    <h2>Nice</h2>
                    <p>Nice is an interesting city. I took a week's worth of French culture lessons here my Junior 
                        year of high school. It is a beautiful city with strong Italian influences... from about
                        six feet and above. Below six feet the city is plagued with trash. However it does lie on 
                        the wonderful southern coast of France and is populated with palm trees which lends a 
                        tropical beauty to the city. The only other downside is that the beach is entirely made up 
                        of rocks, so bring a padded mat if you want to sunbathe by the ocean. I must say that Nice
                        was a lucky place for me though. I found a whole &#8364;1 coin on the boardwalk!

                    <h2>St. Paul de Vence</h2>
                    <P>St. Paul de Vence is one of the few towns on my list that is not surrounded by water. In fact,
                        the town is surrounded by nothing but scrubland as far as the eye can see. And the eye can see 
                        a lot. Situated on the top of a hill in Southern France, there is certian beauty to the scene 
                        none the less. St. Paul de Vence was a popular town with the impressionists of the 18th century as 
                        they claimed the lighting there was suburb.

                    <h2>Monaco</h2>
                    <p>Ok, ok, technically I know Monaco is not a part of France. But that doesn't make the city/state 
                        any less interesting! Monaco is the cleanest city I've ever been to and a point of pride for them.
                        It is fun to walk the roads where the Grand Prix takes place. I heard there is a law that says 
                        you have to be a permanent resident to own a home in the city, so the wealthy buy summer homes there
                        and simply pay housekeepers to turn on lights and make it look constantly populated. Unfortunately 
                        I was too young to go inside the famous Monte Carlo casino.
